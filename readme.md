# Explanation About the my project

## Structure
- First of all, I created the HTML form and I set everything I need there, such as the logo image, `form` element etc.
- When that all set, I started to layout everything in the correct place, with css styling.
- To get the next form, which is the table that showing the list of the book added, I created the headings in the hmtl and I made them as list so that it could be easily for me to arrange them in a row. And the rest of the html are done by javascript.

## What I would improve is :
If I still had more time, I would finish the deleting book form the list and the checkbox.

## New thing that I've learnt
The thing that I learnt form this project is 'storing items inside of the local storage'.

## Challenges:
The most challenging part for me was, again still about deleting a book and the checkbox as well. 

## Request:
I would lie to have a new explanation about the new way of deleting an item as we did with the shopping list.

## Comments
Thank you for giving us this project. It was fun and enjoyable but the only thing is that it is a bit tough.
